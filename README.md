# Learning All Sorts
Never stop learning!

In one's life, lots of things are unknown but interesting, or to say, fascinating. I am kinda addicted to reading books and feels a strange kind of happiness while reading.

In this repository, I will gather all my notes on different subjects and books. I'm a pretty unorganized person, so they might be a bit messy.

## Learning Machine Learning
I am very interested in machine learning in my second year undergraduate studies. They seem to be so powerful in all the fields. So I found lots of books and videos to help me along the way of learning Machine Learning.

### Math for Deep Learning
[*Math for Deep Learning*](https://nostarch.com/math-deep-learning) is a book by Ronald T. Kneusel. It's also what brought me into the field of machine learning. The book covers all the basic math knowledge for learning machine learning, and is very easy to understand. The complexity, for a grade 2 student in university, is just in the right spot. Where I understand something but not everything. Very good book!
