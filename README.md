This is the repository where I keep all my notes for machine learning.

## Math for Deep Learning
[*Math for Deep Learning*](https://nostarch.com/math-deep-learning) is a book by Ronald T. Kneusel. It's also what brought me into the field of machine learning. The book covers all the basic math knowledge for learning machine learning, and is very easy to understand. The complexity, for a grade 2 student in university, is just in the right spot. Where I understand something but not everything. Very good book!
