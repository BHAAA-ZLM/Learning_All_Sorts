## About the Course BIO210
<img src="/extra/homepage.png">

SUSTech BIO210 is a required course for both majors (Life science and Bioinformatics) of the SUSTech Biology department.

The course is taught by [Prof. Xi Chen](https://notarocketscientist.xyz), who is also my instrcutor and a very nice teacher. He made a [website](https://dbrg77.github.io/SUSTech-BIO210/) for this course so let's all go and star it. All course materials and reading materials can be found on the website so I'm not going to copy them over here.

I might consider putting all my Statistics and Probabilities notes from last year's Gab class here. It might happen, after I finished transferring them into $\LaTeX$.

## About the Codes
The language I learned to code in is Java, so my R is a bit poor. There might be a lot of un-elegant coding, so sorry about that. But the coding practices in the homework are really interesting, and I found them very fun.

## About the Homeworks
I gave up using paper to write my homework this year because I predicted there will be a lot of graph drawing and statistical analysis so I decided to write all my homework using R markdown. It is also a great practice for my R abilities. 

You are welcome to look at my homework and notes (if you are lucky and found this GitHub repo) to aid your study and enhance your understanding.

If you are found copying my homework, I will not take any responsibility and will not accept any type of punishment. Because it is entirely your fault, and I will happily talk to the professor and ask him to give you a fail in this course. But if you are not discovered, then good luck.
